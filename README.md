# What is this Repo All About?

In this repository, you'll find the source code for Rust-based examples. While these examples may not be groundbreaking, they are designed to provide a clear understanding of core concepts in Rust.

## Why Am I Using Rust?

\*\*This repository includes a simple example demonstrating how to use Rust. Here are some reasons why Rust is an excellent choice: \*\*

/\* Statically Typed Language: Rust's static typing ensures type safety and helps catch errors at compile time.
Compiled Language: Rust compiles to machine code, offering high performance.
Memory Safe: Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector, preventing common bugs like null pointer dereferences.
Fast: Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++ due to its low-level control.
Safe: Rust emphasizes safety, especially in concurrent programming.
Easy to Learn: While Rust might seem challenging at first, it becomes easier as you get used to its paradigms.

# Why Choose Rust?

    I wanted an alternative to C++ due to its complexity.
    I didn't have any projects where I could effectively use C++.
    Rust is a promising alternative to C++ and is expected to have more applications in the future.
    Learning Rust is particularly beneficial for web development.
